## Framework Version 13

See the [Versioning README](README.md) for more details on framework versions in general.

#### Breaking Changes

- Settings in `config.json` with `hidden` set to `true` are now included where they were not previously.  This ensures that hidden repeatable sub-settings piggy backing off of other repeatable sub-settings will remain associated with each other. See [this API Sync commit](https://github.com/vanderbilt-redcap/api-sync-module/commit/75f62af8ff51e5f1abf47ed35281c17d6649c855) as an example of settings that should be hidden, but cannot be prior to this framework version.  The following scenarios now include `hidden` settings:
  - Calls to `getSubSettings()` and `getConfig()`
  - Setting exports/imports
