## Framework Version 7

See the [Versioning README](README.md) for more details on framework versions in general.

#### Breaking Changes

- The implementation of the undocumented `getData()` method has changed, and is now documented.  For the prior undocumented implementation call `getData_v1()`.
- If skipping framework versions, do not forget to review/address the breaking changes from all prior framework versions.

#### New Features

- Methods on the `Project` object may now be called directly on the module object as well when a `pid` GET variable is set.  For example, `$module->getUsers()` may now be used in place of `$module->getProject()->getUsers()`.
