## Framework Version 11

See the [Versioning README](README.md) for more details on framework versions in general.

#### Breaking Changes

- Using either the PHP or javascript `log()` methods from a NOAUTH context now requires `enable-no-auth-logging` to be `true` in `config.json`.
- If skipping framework versions, do not forget to review/address the breaking changes from all prior framework versions.

#### New Features

- The javascript `module.log()` method now returns a promise resolving to the ID of the log added.
