## Framework Version 9

See the [Versioning README](README.md) for more details on framework versions in general.

#### Breaking Changes

- A bug in the `getSubSettings()` method was fixed related to complex nested subsettings (see commit [c206b62](https://github.com/vanderbilt-redcap/external-module-framework/commit/c206b62c66279343a996ca2f53904d896e29f31a) for details).  The new behavior is desired in all known cases, but the change was made via a framework version to be safe and ensure full backward compatibility.  Modules that use nested subsettings should test thoroughly when upgrading to this framework version.
- If skipping framework versions, do not forget to review/address the breaking changes from all prior framework versions.
