## Framework Version 12

See the [Versioning README](README.md) for more details on framework versions in general.

#### Breaking Changes

- The `permissions` section of `config.json` must be removed, pending potential reappropriation down the road.  Any existing `redcap_` hook methods now run automatically.  Legacy hook methods beginning with `hook_` will need to be renamed to start with `redcap_` instead in order to run.
- If skipping framework versions, do not forget to review/address the breaking changes from all prior framework versions.
