        <p><em>Parcel</em> is a system designed to securely store and manage messages that could contain sensitive data such as protected health information (PHI).</p>
        <p>All messages are encrypted to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the data.</p>
        <p>Additionally, the system includes a functionality that automatically deletes messages once they reach their expiration date.
        This ensures that PHI is only accessible to authorized individuals for the necessary duration, and that it is subsequently removed to maintain compliance with relevant regulations.</p>
        <p>Overall, our messaging system provides a secure and efficient way to manage PHI while maintaining compliance
        with relevant regulations.</p>
